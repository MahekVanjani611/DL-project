# Deep Learning for Severity Loss-Based Knowledge Graph in the Medical Domain

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to develop a **Severity Loss-Based Knowledge Graph (KG) in the medical domain** using **Deep Learning (DL)**. The knowledge graph will model relationships between **diseases, symptoms, severities, and treatments**, leveraging medical datasets to improve diagnostic insights and clinical decision-making.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features
- **Medical Knowledge Graph Construction**: Integrating multiple datasets to form a structured medical KG.
- **Severity-Based Learning**: Assigning severity scores to diseases and symptoms.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Transformers** to enhance KG embeddings.
- **Medical Relation Extraction**: Extracting meaningful relations using NLP techniques.
- **Visualization & Querying**: Interactive exploration of medical severity data.
